<summary>Suburbia</summary>

<p>Set in a world where the supernatural does not exist. Cass is a salaryman and Fandango is a sex worker. They meet when he is hired as a prank for her 40th birthday and hit it off despite the circumstances.</p>
<p>The AU I have spent the most time thinking about! I like imagining the casual domesticity. Also since everyone is mortal there's much angst to be mined from who dies when. There's sort of a loose branching timeline in my mind, I would love to draw it out someday.
</p>
<p>In all scenarios I've considered, Cass dies first. She suffers a heart attack at 58 with two outcomes: she lives or she dies. If she lives things continue on. If she dies, the family in chaos. Fandango is ravaged by grief and becomes depressed and suicidal. Cyrus has to postpone going to college to come home and take care of his siblings while his father is incapacitated. We have two options here as well: Fandango lives or Fandango dies.</p>
<p>If Fandango lives it is only because he begins an romantic and sexual relationship with his son Cyrus. This would likely take the form of Cyrus initiating, perhaps even by force. He instinctively knows his father needs someone else to carry on, and he is that someone. They try to keep this secret from the family, but it's difficult. It hurts not being able to kiss and hold hands in front of everyone else. Problems arise when their secret is discovered. The youngest Martin is too young to care, the twins have their own incestuous thing going on so they don't care, however Maeve takes it extremely hard. She thinks its disgusting and her father and brother are disgusting for doing such a thing with each other. In a bad version Cyrus tells her dad needs this to stay alive, and she tells him she'd rather he be dead. Fandango either overhears this or she tells him to his face. Obviously this does not hit well in his mental state and he attempts to kill himself immediately. </p>

    <summary>Bad End</summary>
<p>An emotionally brutal rape when they're still enemies sets the stage for future strife for Cass and Fandango. Cass manages to subdue and capture Fandango, running a battery of tests in a dubious hospital situation to determine where he got the ability to cheat death. When the truth is revealed (father-son connection) Fandango immediatly makes his own father pleasure him, just to see him suffer. Cass's parently feelings make him the perfect victim. He hates it but he has no choice but to oblige. Fandango turns their situation into a fucked up parody of domesticity, forcing his father into sexual acts and other things by threatening to kill himself. They have a son, Cyrus, who Fandango loves and Cass despises more than anything in the world. A physical reminder of their perverted love and the horrible life he's forced to lead. Cyrus of course grows up very traumatized from this hot and cold duality.</p>

    <summary>Boss and Henchman</summary>
<p>Based on a really hot script I read. Fandango is da boss and Cass is his lackey who has a huge crush and loves to get beat up.</p>

    <summary>Hercules</summary>
<p>It's Disney's Hercules with just a smattering of actual legend. Cass is Hades, who plots Hercules' (Fandango) downfall as revenge for his father Zeus stealing the love of his life, Alcmene. Hades disguises himself as buxom babe Megara to worm his way into Herc's good graces and find his weakness, but winds up falling for him in the process. Hades and Meg manifest together in scenes to display his duality of thought. Of course the twist is Alcmene only went with Zeus bc he threatened her/Hades, and Herc is really Hades' son :3c</p>

    <summary>Beauty and the Beast</summary>
<p>A rare Fandango in transition for this one. Fandango is Belle, a bright bookish girl who's just "not like other girls" for some reason? She loves her adoptive father Maurice and the two look out for each other in a world hostile to anyone different. Story proceeds as usual, idk who Gaston is yet but that could be fun. Turns out the Beast has been cursed for a lot longer than he thought, and is actually Belle's biologial parent (the fairy that cursed him is the other, details TBD).</p>

    <summary>Little Mermaid</summary>
Fandango is Ariel, the youngest mermaid princess who's always been looking for something more. She seeks out the sea witch for help when she becomes infatuated with a handsome human prince. As she struggles to win over the prince without the use of her enchanting voice, the witch shows up to rig the game by winning the prince over herself. Ariel is furious, but somehow every night she wakes up dreaming of tentacles instead of her handsome prince. Of course Ursula is Ariel's mom for this one and its a happy ending when the two of them get together and forget about the princce. Ariel encourages her mom to do better by helping people out for an equitable price.

    <summary>Fairytale/Wizard of Oz</summary>
John and Jane are Jack and Jill and are specifically designed to have bad things happen to them (like vore). Cass/Fandango/Athena get a Wizard of Oz spin. Athena is the wicked witch with an army of flying monkeys, all of which look exactly like Fandango. Cass is the wizard, a spindly con man trying to make it as the biggest name in the Emerald City. So far he's got everyone fooled! Fandango is the magical cloned offspring of the witch and the wizard bc they have a history or something yadda yadda

    <summary>Fallout 4</summary>
After quitting a life of supervillainy and espionage respectively, Cass and Fandango settle down in a quiet little neighborhood to raise their newborn son like regular people. Unfortunately they don't know the world is ending one year later. Fallout setting mashed up with Special Services so theres still magic and furries and stuff. 200 years later everyone thinks things went crazy because of the radiation, but Fandango is there to confirm no, they were kinda like that before. Still playing through the main quest and workshopping how the plot is gonna go.

    <summary>Omegaverse</summary>
Special Services but everyone is part canid and they go through heats and ruts. Alpha/omega is basically another word for trans. Alpha females and omega males are accepted and validated, but kind of commodified and fetishized. Cass is an alpha pack leader, and she winds up owning omega Fandango. Idr if it was the usual espionage stuff or if there was an underground fighting/slavery ring thing. Fandango as a breeding bitch cuz hes too weak to fight.

    <summary>Lesbians</summary>
Special Services but they're both girls! Fandango gets much more easily flustered and won over to the dark side, where she becomes the pampered little pet of mistress Cass.

    <summary>Inverse</summary>
Working from an inverted color palatte, we have the happy family but with a much more fucked up and abusive dynamic. Calamity is the patriarch and rules his little tribe with a cruel and iron fist. He's half slime instead of half vampire. He raped Athena, the mermaid, to procure an heir, Flamenco. He abuses and rapes his daughter, leaving her hoplessly depressed and suicidal, but he won't let her die. Trying his luck again, he concieves a child with her, the bubbly and effervescent Lucy. Lucy doesn't earn his approval as a daughter because she was born with a penis, but she's too bimbo to know that daddy doesn't love her. Suffered horrific childhood abuse as well, but it doesn't seem to have dampered her spirits in the slightest. Flamenco doesn't know how she does it. In fact, she resents her pretty bad for still being in love with their daddy. In a good end, the two escape and end up living happily together. In a bad end Flamenco ends up just as much under Lucy's thumb as their father, though Lucy's abuse is motivated entirely by love.
